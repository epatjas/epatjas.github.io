# Elina Patjas - Product Designer

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is the repo for my portfolio site. I build stuff for the web and mobile, focusing on edtech and well, all interesting tech.

## What's This All About?

This site showcases some of my work in product design and development. It's built with React because, well, I like React.

## What I Do

- Figure out what to build and why
- Make interfaces that don't confuse people
- Turn complex stuff into simple designs
- Talk to users (yes, actual humans)
- Work with devs without causing mutual headaches

## Tech Stack

- React (because components are life)
- Next.js (for that sweet, sweet performance)
- CSS Modules (keeping styles in check)
- Git (obviously)
- Figma (my digital playground)

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing new opportunities, sharing insights, or collaborating on innovative projects.
