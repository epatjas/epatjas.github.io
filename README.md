Hey there! 👋 I'm Elina.

TL;DR: Product Designer who codes (or at least tries to). Pixel perfectionist. Techno lover.

I'm a product designer by trade, but I've got a not-so-secret love affair with code. Yeah, I'm one of those designers who can't resist tinkering with React components when I should be in Figma.

## What's my deal?

- 🎨 Seasoned product designer (been doing this for 15+ years now)
- 💻 Self-taught front-end developer (because why not?)
- 🤓 UX/UI nerd with a penchant for clean, intuitive designs
- 🛠️ Builder of my own portfolio site (it's a React app, of course)

## Check out my work

Curious about what I actually do? My portfolio site is where the magic happens. It's a React app I built from scratch (yes, I'm a bit proud of it).
