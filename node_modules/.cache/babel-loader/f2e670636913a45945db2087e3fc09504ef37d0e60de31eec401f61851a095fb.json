You can reach out any weekday, and I'm flexible for calls or meetings as needed. We'll set clear goals for what needs to get done each week or month, and I'll make sure to deliver on time. This setup means you get the benefits of a dedicated design partner without the full-time commitment. It's all about moving your project forward efficiently while giving you the space to focus on other aspects of your business.\"\n    }\n  ];\n\n  const clients = [\n    \"Otava Learning\",\n    \"City of Helsinki\",\n    \"Fira\",\n    \"Vaisala\",\n    \"Kotipizza\",\n    \"Hartwall\",\n    \"Kone\",\n    \"Froneri Finland\",\n    \"Metso\",\n    // Add more clients as needed\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"about-page dark-theme\">  \n      <section className=\"about-me\">\n        <h2>About Me</h2>\n        <div className=\"about-content\">\n          <div className=\"about-image\">\n            <img src={getImagePath('elina.png')} alt=\"Profile\" />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"about-text\">\n            <h3>I help companies ship high-quality products, fast.</h3>\n            <p>As your design partner, I will:</p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>Contribute to product strategy and direction, focusing on actionable insights rather than excessive documentation</li>\n              <li>Create rapid, high-fidelity interactive prototypes to test and validate ideas efficiently</li>\n              <li>Lead end-to-end design projects, collaborating closely with engineering teams for swift iteration and high-quality implementation</li>\n              <li>Come up with features and improvements that ship quickly and with high-quality</li>\n              <li>Build and nurture a successful design team within your company</li>\n              <li>Establish design-centric processes that promote attention to detail and quality</li>\n            </ul>\n            <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elinapatjas/\" className=\"view-resume\">View resume →</a>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n      \n      <section className=\"approach\">\n        <h2>Approach</h2>\n        <div className=\"approach-grid\">\n          {approachItems.map((item, index) => (\n            <div key={index} className=\"approach-item\">\n              <h3>\n                <span className=\"approach-number\">{`0${index + 1}`}</span>{' '}\n                <span dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: item.title }} />\n              </h3>\n              <p>{item.description}</p>\n            </div>\n          ))}\n        </div>\n      </section>\n\n      <Testimonials \n        title=\"What they say\"\n        testimonials={testimonials}\n      />\n\n      <section className=\"clients-section\">\n        <h2>Clients</h2>\n        <p>I've had the pleasure of working with some great clients along the way.
